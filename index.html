        Our Mission
      </h2>
      <p id="mission_text">One in ten computer science students in Victoria begin their first semester without access to
        a personal laptop. This lack of ownership can limit opportunities for self-expression and independence,
        potentially contributing to increased stress and early mental health challenges.

        <br>
        Our mission is to equip the next generation with the tools they need to shape the world and themselves,
        ultimately improving the lives of all.
        <br>
        When you donate to The Charity, you're giving a student the chance to truly experience university life. And with
        a gift like that, you're definitely earning some good karma. :D
