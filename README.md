# Username and Password
The username and password for the manage.php page is 'admin'. 

# Set Up
To work on your local machine, create a database name database and the import database.sql
The website as provided in this github uses relative links running directly from the domain. This means if using XAMPP for example the files need to be placed directly into the HTDOCS.
Essentially localhost/jobs.php good  localhost/project2/jobs.php bad
As well as cleaner link structure this allows for the project to be more malleable working within any folder name.

The submission however has a small change with links including project2/ folder system due to project2 folder being included in file layout.

Alternatively open your browser and access generate.php to generate it for you
